                    As the Avengers and their allies have continued to protect
                    the world from threats too large for any one hero to handle,
                    a new danger has emerged from the cosmic shadows: Thanos. A
                    despot of intergalactic infamy, his goal is to collect all
                    six Infinity Stones, artifacts of unimaginable power, and
                    use them to inflict his twisted win on all of reality.
                    Everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this
                    moment - the fate of Earth and existence itself has never
                    been more uncertain.
